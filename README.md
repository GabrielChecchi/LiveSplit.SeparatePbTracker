LiveSplit.SeparatePbTracker
=====================

This LiveSplit component creates a new Comparison called 'PB', where it'll separately keep track of your RT PB and IGT PB. This means that if you beat your IGT PB, but not your RT PB, then it'll only update your IGT PB and it'll leave your RT PB as it was. The same applies for RT PB. This component doesn't display anything on LiveSplit.
